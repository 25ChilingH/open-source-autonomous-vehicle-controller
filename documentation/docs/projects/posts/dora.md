## Project Objectives

The D.O.R.A project aims to provide a comprehensive and adaptable learning platform for flight controls education by:

- Developing a cost-effective airframe with easily replaceable parts.
- Creating a modular software framework that enables students to gain hands-on experience in flight controls.
- Offering detailed documentation and a user-friendly GUI interface for ease of use.
- Empowering students to explore and modify the flight system in both simulated and real-world scenarios.
- Demonstrating the project's capabilities through a physical aircraft, gimbal, and ground station interface.
- Validating the project's dynamic operational potential for indoor and outdoor learning without sacrificing the crucial aspect of physical intuition.
