# Slug Autonomous Surface Vehicle Project

> The Slug Autonomous Surface Vehicle Project is a pioneering effort aimed at revolutionizing oceanography by developing a robust autonomous vehicle. This vehicle is designed to significantly reduce the cost associated with gathering oceanographic data. The project's ultimate goal is to create an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) capable of performing waypoint tracking, optimal exploration, and data collection in marine environments.

## Introduction

This project's primary objective is to design, develop, and deploy an advanced autonomous surface vehicle capable of efficient data acquisition for oceanography. The focus is on creating a low-cost, high-volume solution that contributes to the reduction of oceanographic research expenses. By employing a systems engineering approach, this project addresses the comprehensive framework and design required for such an autonomous vehicle.
